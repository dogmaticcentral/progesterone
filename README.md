# Progesterone

This is a set of scripts that try to answer the question: is it possible that a gene A 
is under control of transcription  factor B, given currently available experimental 
evidence?

This is not a library  - the scripts are loosely connected by some coomon methods 
in the utils module. They have been tested to run under python 3.6.6, and are supposed 
to be run in the  order in which they are enumerated. They answer a series of 
sub-questions, which may add up to an answer. Depends on the answer you are hoping for.

## What's this TAD business

## Which TAD does my gene belong to

## Where are ChIPSeq regions on the chromosome

## Which regions come  in contact within the TAD (and how often)

## Deja vu all over again: mouse data

## Putting it all together

## So, functional TF sites or not?
Print the table you have just made, and take it to a competent experimentalist. 
(S)he might be able to help.
